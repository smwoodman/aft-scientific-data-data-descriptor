## Introduction {#sec-intro}

This is a dummy example only for the purpose to use this repo as a template starter for creating new formats.  For this `article-format-template` we call our dummy article `aft`. 

This quarto extension format supports PDF and HTML outputs. `quarto-journals` is aiming at porting existing {{< latex >}} template from journals to be used with quarto. PDF format is what require the most work to fit the journals guideline, but Quarto offer a nice rendering for HTML output too. This demo format template only use basic HTML format without any customization for now.

## About Quarto Extensions formats And Quarto Journals Article

First, please get familiar with the following resources: 

- [Creating Formats](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html) in Quarto as part of the [Extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) mechanism.
- [Journals Articles](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/) for Quarto.

## Structure of this repository

Everything for the extensions is in `_extensions`. See Quarto doc for details. 

- In `partials`, you'll find the `.tex` partials that can be used and should be removed or tweaked,s

- Your extension can make shortcodes and lua filters available. This document shows the effect of the one provided in the `aft` format. 

- `aft` format sets some defaults which are different from `pdf` or `html`, link setting links to URL in read inside PDF output.

Source repository for this template format can found on [Github](https://github.com/quarto-journals/article-format-template)


### `_extensions\aft` 

In this folder you'll find everything that defines the extensions which could be installed using `quarto install extension` or be part of the template when using `quarto use template`

Format Metadata
  ~ This is in `_extension.yml` is where all the metadata about the format are defined so that Quarto knows what to use.
  Adapt this file for you own template.

Partials
  ~ In `partials`, there are the `.tex` files that will be used as Pandoc's template. We provide here all the partials supported by Quarto and custom one for this format. Quarto allows to provide partials to ease the process of tweaking the default latex Pandoc's template and keeping it up to date.  
    This template repo contains all the relevant partials that you can use with Quarto _as example_. We only tweaked `title.tex` to show the usage of a custom partials called `_custom.tex`.  
    **Only keep the partials that you need to tweak for the format you are creating**

    If you need to completely change the default template (i.g customizing partials is not enough), then you need to provide your own template to Pandoc based on [`template.tex`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/pdf/pandoc/template.tex) and also using partials or not. This can be provided using the `template` YAML key in `_extension.yml` for Quarto to use it. 

    This is considered advanced configuration as it will be harder to maintain than only using partials but could be required for some specific format. Be aware that this may lead to loose some Pandoc or Quarto features tied to default `template.tex` content if you remove some specific parts.
